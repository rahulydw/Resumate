# Resumate

## 🧠 Background / Motivation

> *"While I was working on my own resume, I couldn’t find any template that matched the design I had in mind. Some online tools looked good, but they either lacked customization options or were too expensive. Creating resumes in MS Word felt boring and creatively limited. As a web developer, I thought — why not build something that gives full creative control, feels modern, and can help others too? That’s how **Resumate** was born — a project where building a resume turned into building a product, and real tech skills were practiced in the process."*

**Design & Developed by Rahul Yadav**

Resumate is a MERN Stack-based resume builder that empowers developers and non-coders to create pixel-perfect, A4-sized, printable resumes using custom HTML & Tailwind CSS. This project is built with the goal to practice MERN technologies and also help others build resumes with full layout control.

## 🚀 Purpose

- 💡 **Learning-Focused**: This project is made mainly for learning and practical implementation of MERN stack concepts.
- 💻 **Developer Friendly**: Developers who already know HTML, CSS, and Tailwind can write or paste their own code and generate A4 accurate printable resumes.
- 🤖 **AI Integration Ready**: In future, developers can prompt an AI to generate resume code (HTML + Tailwind) from given content or template, and paste it here to get a downloadable PDF.
- 🧩 **Two Modes**:
  - **Dev Mode**: Custom design with Tailwind or AI-generated templates.
  - **Non-Dev Mode**: Form-based input to auto-generate resume using pre-built templates.

## 🧠 Why Resumate?

Unlike many existing resume builders that are either overpriced or lack customization, **Resumate** gives:
- Full design control for devs
- Easy form-based resume creation for non-coders
- Accurate A4 size layout in both preview & PDF
- A platform to **practice**, **experiment**, and **build** real resumes
